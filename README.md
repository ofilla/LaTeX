# LaTeX

Here one can find my LaTeX-configfiles. Every Document to be compiled with the script *compile_all* must be in the directory *tex_compile*.
Other files, as the header and contents, can be stored in *tex_contents*. The PDF files can be found in *pdfoutput*, temporary files will be in *tmp*.
